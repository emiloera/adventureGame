My game is called The Forest
You are lost in the forest, but you still have shelter at the camp where you can go later one once 
it is night time to sleep. You are able to interact with different objects as you head to different 
directional places in the forest, such as north south, east and west. But you must find the three 
main objects: a map, a compass and a flashlight to help you escape.
